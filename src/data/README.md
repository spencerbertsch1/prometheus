# Data Readme

Because this is a reinforcement learning project, the data needed to train the wildfire 
containment agenst is so small (under 25MB) that it can be versioned using git. The data 
stored in this directory comes primarily from 
[this next day wildfire spread](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fantineh/next-day-wildfire-spread) data set. 

The data stored here includes: 
- Elevation 
- Wind speed
- Vegetation
- Population Density
- Fire Mask 

This data is used to create a model of the environment in which agents attempt to contain the fire
and minimize total damage over the episode.
