# A Wildfire Containment API Client for Python 3

### Part I: Wildfire Containment API Client
This repository contains an easy-to-use library for writing AI bots used to contain wildfires. This API was designed to be simple and straightforward. Whether testing agents over videos of actual recorded fires or synthetic fire data, generating maps and testing AI bots (agents) should only take a few lines of code. 


### Part II: Reinforcement Learning Solutions 
As part of a research initiative at Dartmouth College, this repository also contains model-based and model-free RL models needed for tactical, real time wildfire containment.
